## Notebook Drafts

A repository for storing and organizing my work-in-progress Jupyter notebooks. This is a sandbox environment where I explore ideas, experiment with code, and develop new analyses.

### Note

These notebooks are a work in progress and may contain incomplete or experimental code. Finalized versions may be moved to other repositories.
